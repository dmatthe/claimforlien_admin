  <p>and attack the Romulans. Your head is not an artifact! Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. The unexpected is our normal routine. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Computer, lights up!</p>

  <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
