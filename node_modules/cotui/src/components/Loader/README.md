# Button
A button is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.


## Implementation
~~~js
const ui = new COTUI();
ui.Button({
  label:'Submit',
  className:'btn-primary'
})
~~~

~~~html
<cotui-button>Submit</cotui-button>
~~~


## Usability
When buttons are used to trigger an action such as submitting/saving cancelling/deleting they must be located flush left if the content area

The affirmative actions (continue/save) are on the __left__ of the button group.

The dismissive action of a button (cancel/delete) is always on the __right__ of the button group. Dismissive actions return to the user to the previous state.


Button labels must always be in an active voice and tell the user what is going to happen when they click it.

~~~html
Good <Button>Submit my Application</Button>
Bad <Button>Submit</Button>
~~~

A common convention for informing users that a button launches a __modal__ is to append "…" (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., "Save as…".

~~~html
Good <Button onClick={openModal()}>Save Document As...</Button>
Bad <Button onClick={openModal()}>Save</Button>
~~~
